# Instructions

Run

```bash
npm run generate
npm run dev
```

The server will be online on `localhost:3000` and you can use your Metamask/Brave Wallet, the hardhat faucet produces accounts with 1000ETH (It's not going to make you rich unfortunately) and these are fake accounts that you can use the private key of to import in your wallet and sell/buy NFTs.
